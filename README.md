# Kaggle Environment Setup Script
This repository contains a Bash script designed to streamline the setup of Kaggle competition environments. It automates the creation of a project directory, setting up a Python virtual environment, installing dependencies, initializing a Git repository, and preparing Docker for Kaggle Python projects.

## Features
- Project Structure Creation: Automatically generates a directory structure for Kaggle projects.
- Virtual Environment: Sets up a Python virtual environment and installs necessary libraries from requirements.txt.
- Git Initialization: Initializes a Git repository and makes the first commit.
- Docker Integration: Creates a Dockerfile pulling the official Kaggle Python image and sets up your project within a Docker container.
- Kaggle API Setup: Copies your kaggle.json to the project root for easy access to Kaggle APIs.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:
- Git
- Python 3.8 or newer
- Docker (optional)
- The Kaggle CLI (pip install kaggle)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone <repository-url>.
2. Place Your Kaggle API Key: Ensure your kaggle.json file (containing your Kaggle API credentials) is in the same directory as the setup script.
3. Run the Script: Navigate to the repository directory and run the setup script with your desired project name:
    ```bash
    Copy code
    ./setup-kaggle.sh my_kaggle_project
    ```
4. Docker Usage: After running the script, use the following command to work with your project in a Docker container:
    ```bash
    Copy code
    docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -v "$PWD/my_kaggle_project":/home/cq kaggle_project_image
    ```
    Adjust the port mappings and volume as needed for your project.


## Security Note
- Kaggle API Key: Your kaggle.json contains sensitive information. The script copies this file to the project directory but ensures it is listed in .gitignore to prevent it from being pushed to any repository.
## Customization
- Requirements File: The script uses requirements.txt for Python dependencies. Modify this file before running the script if you have specific libraries you need installed.
- Dockerfile: If additional modifications are needed for the Docker environment, you can adjust the Dockerfile generated by the script.
## Contribution
- Contributions to this script are welcome. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
